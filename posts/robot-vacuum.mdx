title: I never have to vacuum again
description: Or, making my Eufy robot vacuum talk to HomeKit

The problem: Eufy doesn't integrate with HomeKit.
The solution: I already have Homebridge running on a Raspberry Pi. So get the vacuum set up in Homebridge.
Troubleshooting.
Homebridge homebridge-eufy-robovac
Find deviceId and localKey
Android Studio
Bluestacks

1. Eufy robot vaccum talks to Homebridge. 2. I never need to vacuum again. 3. Profit. Maybe I will be an Android developer now.
