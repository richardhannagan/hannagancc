[Here](/russia.pdf) is my first Squarespace project from a couple of years ago. Looks pretty good right? But paying Squarespace $10 a month seems pretty silly when I could do all the hosting for free myself, so this post describes that process.

First things first, the band used to be called Russia. We picked it in 2016 on the pattern of the band America (A Horse With No Name, Ventura Highway, etc.) It was just a word that wasn't already a band name and you could make the esses lightning bolts in gig posters. But then in early 2022 people started sending us Ukraine flag emojis on Instagram and it became clear we needed a new name.

So, International Funk Waters. Or, International Waters Funk. I bought both domains because it's still up for debate.
