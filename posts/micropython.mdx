#### Introduction

A couple of weeks ago I went to a Python meetup event, and learned about MicroPython, a stripped down version of Python designed to run on microcontrollers. Developed by a guy in Geelong.

I've had an idea for a while to build a tide-computer of sorts. Why? Where I live there's a canal that's tidal, of course.  A walk along the canal at high tide is like a walk along a beatiful river in Italy. But a visit at low tide smells like trash. A simple screen next to the front door letting you know whether it's a good idea to visit the canal before leaving the house seems it could be just as important as knowing the weather before you leave the house.

The obvious question is why do I need a whole device dedicated to this one purpose? And my non-answer-answer is why does one need a watch that tells the time and nothing else, when your phone can do that and almost anything else you want.

In fact, my phone already does this with a relatively clean looking home screen widget. But if you open the app it doesn't display the tide immediately, it first displays an ad. Additionally I just think e-paper/e-ink screens are pretty neat. See: Amazon Kindle.

So, I purchased a Raspberry Pi Pico and a small 2 inch e-ink screen. People talk about these costing $4 which doesn't really seem to be true but I ended up paying $11.55 plus shipping for the version with pre-soldered headers and with built-in Wifi and Bluetooth, which is pretty ridiculous when you can't get a pint of beer for that little any more.

So after a couple of days waiting for the postman to pretend I wasn't home and a visit to the post office, here's the development process:

####  Setting up an IDE

The documentation suggests using Thonny, which I already had setup on my computer to play with some (non-micro) Python scripting. It has a neat mode where you can directly interact with the REPL on the Pico.

**Installing Micropython**

####  Getting tide data
bom Your access is blocked due to the detection of a potential automated access request. The Bureau of Meteorology website does not support web scraping: if you are trying to access Bureau data through automated means, you should stop.

####  Getting the Pico online
following instructions to use wifi
accidentally posting my wifi password on github

####  Getting the LED to flash

3 lines gets flashes the on-board LED on the Pico W model:

```
import machine
led = machine.Pin("LED", machine.Pin.OUT)
led.toggle()
```

This will come in handy later for...

####  Debugging
debugging with the LED
clock not setting when unplugged
timezones
But if ur running the things from computer it sets its clock that was why
It works if I plug the pico into the computer but if I just plug it into a usb power thing only it stops at like     current_time equals utime dot localtime but I dunno why lmk x

####  Testing (what's the difference between debugging and testing?)


####  The finished (for now) product
So it works

#### Conclusion

For now it's plugged into my Ikea lamp which has a built in USB-A port for a quick glance in the morning. I look forward to 3D printing a case for it, coming up with an elegant solution for powering it (assuming it draws almost no power) and mounting it on a wall.
